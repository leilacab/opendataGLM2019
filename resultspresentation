# **London congestion charge (implemented in 2003): evolution of traffic in the Greater London Area from 2000 to 2018**

##Summary:
Drawing from data on traffic in the Greater London Area from 2000 to 2018, this note presents an evolution of traffic in London prior the implementation of the congestion zone, and following its implementation in 2003. We show **evolution of traffic in London over space and time**. We find that, following the implementation of the congestion zone, the areas that show the most significant changes in traffic flows are the core center and the extreme outskirt of the metropolitan area. Intermediary areas have not been too strongly impacted by the congestion zone. If completed by other elements to confirm the causality of these changes in traffic and the implementation of the congestion zone, one policy recommendation would be that **the current shape of the congestion zone is not necessarily the most efficient to target traffic**.
